# About Me
> My name is *Gabriel Goulart*🙋🏻, I'm *15 years old*⌚ and I'm from *Brazil*🇧🇷. I love **exploring the web**, and that's why I wanted to learn **HTML and CSS**. I already have some experience with **JavaScript and Python**, but now I've decided to focus on **web development**, at least for now.

> But, in addition to web development, I'd like to be a pentester - I love the idea that a professional can protect vulnerabilities before malicious individuals exploit them.
